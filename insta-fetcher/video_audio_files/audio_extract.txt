The OnePlus Pad 2 is one of the best Android tablets for gaming
One proof when we played 5 of our favourite games which includes TTS and Andreas, Diablo Immortal, Call of Duty, Genshin Impact and BGMI
And you know what, in Genshin Impact which is one of the most demanding games on mobile by the way, we got an average FPS of 59.49 frames per second
This is higher than some of the Snapdragon 8 and 3 phones that we've tested
BGMI gave us a consistent 85 FPS, Call of Duty was also locked at 120 FPS
Of course in Call of Duty when you get into the menu, the frames will drop because the menu doesn't run at 120 FPS
Even GTS and Andreas and Diablo Immortal gave us 30 FPS and 60 FPS respectively
Trust me, if the game engines running these games allowed for it, then these numbers would be even higher
The reason for such good performance is of course the fact that it gets Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, it gets 12 GB of LPDDR 5X RAM type as well
The only downside is UFS 3.1 but still the performance is great
And if you're gaming on an Android tablet, you need a large screen, right? Well, the OnePlus Pad 2 comes with a 12.1 inch IPS LCD display with 900 nits of peak brightness and 3K resolution
So it's crisp, it's bright and extremely color accurate too
Also the Pad 2 is going to get a bunch of AI features really soon, so if you're considering buying one, that could be one reason as well
So the OnePlus Pad 2 is available for Rs
40,000 and for that price, it's an instant recommendation from me
Would you buy it or not? Let me know in the comments below
But you know what the real question is? Can it still play Crysis? It's still...
